## Example
*none*
## Purpose
The Safety Requirements Viewpoint
* identifies and defines the specific safety goal per hazard
* elicit and supports the documentation of the derived functional safety requirements for System of Interest based on the safety goal
* supports the definition of the SoI Safe State
## Applicability
The Safety Requirements Viewpoint enables a model-based "System Safety Engineering" as Speciality Engineering Activity of the INCOSE SYSTEM ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [$ 4.1].
## Stakeholder
* [Safety Expert](../stakeholders.md#safety-expert)
* [Regulation Authority](../stakeholders.md#Regulation-Authority)
## Concern
* Which Safety Goal has the System of Interest has to achieve in order to countermeasure an identified hazard?
* Which Functional Safety Requirements (as System Safety Functions) can be derived from the Safety Goal?
* What is the Safe State of the System of Interest?
## Presentation
A requirements diagram depicts the particular hazard and defines the according Safety Goal and derived Functional Safety Requirements.
